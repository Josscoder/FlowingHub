FlowingHub is a broker project developed with Netty that uses TCP to send packets. This project allows clients to connect
to the broker and send and receive real-time messages reliably and efficiently over a stable TCP connection. FlowingHub
is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of simultaneous client traffic, making it an ideal solution for
high-demand applications. With FlowingHub, developers can easily and efficiently create robust and scalable real-time
communication applications.
